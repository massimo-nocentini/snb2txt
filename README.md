# snb2txt

A Python script that converts Samsung's SNB files to TXT files.

No deps are required, just use a Python 3 interpreter as follows:

```bash
$ python3 snb2txt.py <dir>

```

where `<dir>` is the directory that contains your SNB files.

The converted TXT files will be saved in the same directory with the same file name but with the `.txt` extension.
